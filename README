# cljmex

MATLAB Mex file generator

The project website is https://github.com/nefan/cljmex

Stefan Sommer (sommer@diku.dk), November 2012.


## Usage

Instead of writing ugly C-code yourself to pass data between MATLAB and
mex-files, you write a short clojure file. Executing the clojure file then
produces a header file with macros for passing the data back and forth. The
C-part of the corresponding mex-file will then look like:

#include "mexfile.cljmex.hpp"

cljmex_start()

    // regular C-code
    ...

cljmex_end()

See also the examples files in the examples/ directory.


## License

Everything here is GPL.


## Installation

Confer the INSTALL file.


## Documentation

For now, look at the files in the examples/ directory. cljmex contains more
parameters and input/output formats than used in the examples. More will be
added as needed, and, eventually, the available parameters may be documented.
It's very easy to add new functionality (thanks, clojure), so feel free to send
me a patch or an email with a wish list.


## News
November 2012: project started.
